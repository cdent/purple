Purple -- Granular addressability for the web and beyond
========================================================

Purple generates stable, immutable identifiers that may be used to
address granular content.  These identifiers generally manifest
themselves as "purple numbers."

On the web, you can always link to documents, but linking to granular
content like paragraphs in a document is a shakier proposition.
Purple lets you link or transclude granular content on the web.

Purple:

  * Generates identifiers and associates them with a URL.  That
    identifier can then be used as a stable address, even if the
    URL changes.

  * Provides an HTTP interface for retrieving and updating identifiers
    in the database.
